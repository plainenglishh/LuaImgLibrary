## About

This library intends to provide he ability to decode, process and encode images in Roblox's LuaU.

> [!WARNING]  
> This is a work in progress and is not ready to be used. I recommend you use MaximumADHD's PNG library (which the PNG decoder in this project is influenced by) for the time being.

The '/src' folder is configured for Roblox by default, you can simply download it's contents and import it directly into your project.

Alternatively, you can run the 'build.lua' script using a recent version of [Lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) to build the library into a minified form.
